Doing the following below will increase your free hours each week, and in most cases each day. Since implementing this, I can usually save 21 hours per month, or an average of 5 hours per day which translates into more time spent into side-hustle or creative endeavor.

1. Insta breakfast -> 6 open pasture, organic raw eggs with hemp/coconut milk to chase. 4 slices of Salmon Sashimi. Optionally grab some leafy greens, olive oil, vinegar and add a salad. 

Saved time = 15 minutes cooking, 5 minutes cleaning and placing back in the cupboard = 20 minutes

2. E-book or Stanford/MIT lecture during commute (Saved time = 2*20 minutes back and fourth = 40 minutes)

3. Walking meals: 
	-Baked and seasoned chicken breast, cut into pieces and wrapped in tin foil with roasted carrots, peppers, potatoes.
	-Slices of steak mixed with steamed cauliflower and broccoli 

4. Batch laundry and strategic clothing re-use. Before you say eww gross, think about where most of your sweat goes. Underwear, socks, undershirt, bedsheets. That's it. These are the cheapest type of clothes so it makes sense to double or even triple your inventory of these clothes. I personally sweat a lot and will buy extra thick/high quality/high absorption brands of the undergarments. If you don't sweat gallons like I do, the cheap basic kind will do just fine. 

I will have at least 1 nice out shirt/pants for each day of the week. This means I only have to do laundry once every 3 weeks, instead of most people doing it once every week. Little things like this add up, you'll have 6-8 more hours of free time each week. That's like an entire work day off!


5. Cooking optimization. If you haven't already, take a look at [oil fat thesis]. The most efficient way to cook isn't necc. the fastest. Think about all the actions you do while cooking. You stir, fry, maybe add in a special spice at the half way mark. I say screw all that, I just want it to be relatively tasty and easy! But I don't want to eat ramen and instant mac all day. 

The good news is you don't. You just need to experiment with the following cooking methods:

1. Not even cooking: This is obviously the fastest way and also preserves more nutrients as a kicker. It will preserve more pro-biotics which is arguably more important as well. The following foods I've eaten raw (** medical disclaimer) without ANY issues whatsoever. Make sure you get them from a reputable source (e.g. whole foods, they are still FRESH, and most importantly they are organic). I recommend serving all raw meats in salt and vinegar (e.g. soy sauce). 
	-Beef Steak
	-Lamb steaks
	-Salmon
	-Tuna
	-Eggs
	-Scallop
	-Squid
	-Mackeral
	-Sea bass

DO NOT EVER EAT RAW PORK OR CHICKEN, PERIOD. Ground lamb and beef is questionable because more of the meat is exposed to the outside sources (e.g. the blade that cuts it up, other people's hands). I personally have never ate completely raw ground lamb or beef, but have often eaten it extremely rare (but cooked).

2. Using the oven to prepare the marinated meat, eating the vegetables raw or lightly steamed via microwave. This process takes seconds, you then sit back and wait until every thing is done. When the meat is cooked, while you are preparing the veggies you allow the oven to cool. For steak and lamb steak, this process can be replicated on the fryer just the same.
