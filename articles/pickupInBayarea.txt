How to pick up girls in the Bay area

Most guys who go out in the Bay area are software engineers. This can be interpreted as really good, or really really bad. 

Now I'm a firm believer that game is more or less the same no matter where you are. EXCEPT THE INITIAL IMPRESSION. That is an important nuance. For example, you won't get very far cat-calling in NYC, nor will a direct approach be safe in the Middle East. Likewise for the Bay area, if your first impression is boring, no-fun, stick-up-your-ass start up guy... I've got some bad news. 

I shall expand on this further, but since this is my first post and you guys have limited time. Things to stop doing on your nights out.

1. Try and act cool. This involves trying to impress the girl, spinning your wheels for her, qualify yourself, trying not to lose. Don't go out with your co-workers who aren't into game. They'll likely misinterpret and you will be distracted. What you need to do instead is stop judging yourself and enjoy talking to every single girl equally (the thick ones and the thin ones, nom sayin).

2. Mention your job (unless you are a pro athlete, sky-diver, model, actor, musician or director). If the girl ever asks you what you do (EVEN IF YOUR STARTUP IS PROFITABLE AND JUST GOT 3 MILLION IN SEED), just say 'Sales'. Lead, change topic to something more exciting. 

3. Leaving at first 'token' objection. Girls will get nervous around you even if things are going well. Girls are like most people. If you are standing around talking to the same person for 15 minutes, anxiety will creep in. Allevieate this tension by SEEDING the idea that you guys will hang out later. This allows you to 
	A. Introduce her to your friends, when she starts looking around.
	B. Have her give you her number - with the purpose of meeting up later to hang out.
